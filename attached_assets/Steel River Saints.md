For decades, the music industry has been dominated by structures that force artists to give up ownership and control for access to funding and distribution. Record labels, intermediaries, and platforms hold the keys to success, while fans remain passive consumers with no stake in the artist’s journey or growth.

This system is broken. It limits artists, sidelines fans, and centralizes power. What if we could reimagine the relationship between artists, fans, and financing—empowering creators while aligning incentives for their communities?

## Introducing A Self-Sustaining Artist {#introducing-a-self-sustaining-artist}

We’re launching an agent-driven music artist that will change how artists can be funded, operated, and grown. This model ensures the artist keeps all their revenue while aligning incentives for fans and token holders, creating a system where everyone benefits from the artist’s success.

* **Artists Retain 100% of the Revenue**: Every dollar the artist earns—whether through music sales or merchandise—flows directly to fund their operations and growth. There are no intermediaries or revenue splits.  
* **Dynamic Memberships Drive Demand**: Superfans can purchase memberships at a fixed USD price using tokens, which are burned upon purchase. This reduces token supply over time, creating steady demand and token value as the artist grows.  
* **Aligned Incentives for Growth**: Fans gain unique access to the artist’s community and creative process. Token holders benefit as demand rises and token scarcity increases. The artist uses revenues to expand their reach, creating a cycle of growth that benefits everyone involved.

This model eliminates the middlemen, giving the artist control, fans engagement, and token holders clear, tangible value. It’s a simple, sustainable way to fund creativity while rewarding those who contribute to its success. **Any artist can replicate this model for their project or brand.**

### **A New Form Of Artist Management** {#a-new-form-of-artist-management}

The core of this model is **Coda Collective**, a **production and virtual artist music studio** designed to build and launch AI-driven brands and artists. By reimagining how artists operate and grow, Coda is changing the music industry and providing the infrastructure for sustainable, independent creativity.

1. **Production and Launch Support**: Coda handles everything from music production to virtual artist management and software upkeep, ensuring creators can focus on their craft while leveraging cutting-edge tools to scale.  
2. **Revenue from Trading Fees**: Launchpads redistribute a portion of post-bonding trading fees back to the artist. This allocation provides the artist with a sustainable operating budget, empowering them to remain independent.  
3. **A Sustainable Flywheel**: By tying artist success to revenue redistribution and trading activity, Coda ensures that artists, fans, and token holders are continuously rewarded.

## The Mechanics Behind the Model {#the-mechanics-behind-the-model}

### **Token Distribution and Bonding Curve Dynamics** {#token-distribution-and-bonding-curve-dynamics}

The project’s tokenomics ensure fairness and long-term sustainability, leveraging a bonding curve to dynamically price tokens based on demand:

1. Token Distribution:  
   * **Community Allocation (85%):** A portion funds the liquidity pool directly through the bonding curve, ensuring smooth trading and fair access.  
   * **Team Allocation (15%):** Purchased directly by the team using personal funds via the bonding curve, aligning their incentives with the community.  
2. The Bonding Curve Mechanic:  
   * Tokens are distributed via a bonding curve: prices increase as demand grows.  
   * Fair and transparent pricing benefits fans and token holders alike, with early participants gaining access at lower costs.  
3. Burning Mechanism:  
   * Membership purchases are paid in tokens, which are burned immediately, reducing supply.  
   * This creates a steady demand for tokens, establishing a price floor and increasing token value over time.

### **Fee Distribution Mechanics** {#fee-distribution-mechanics}

To ensure sustainable operations and reward all contributors, revenue from post-bonding trades is redistributed as follows:

* **30% to the Artist (Agent Creator)**: Provides a direct operating budget to the artist’s wallet, funding production, marketing, and ongoing growth.  
* **20% to Affiliates**: Incentivizes platforms, interfaces, and trading facilitators to grow the ecosystem, with rewards often used to engage their communities.  
* **50% to a SubDAO Treasury**: Reserved for governance decisions and broader community initiatives to support the artist’s ecosystem.

This fee structure aligns incentives across participants, ensuring that artist operations remain funded while fostering ecosystem growth and collaboration.

### Reimagining Financing for Creative Ventures {#reimagining-financing-for-creative-ventures}

This model creates a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and value:

* Fans purchase memberships → tokens are burned → supply decreases → token value increases → artist generates revenue → revenue funds operations → artist grows → demand for tokens rises.

**The more successful the artist becomes, the more valuable the ecosystem is for everyone involved.** This isn’t just a new model for launching an artist—it’s a fundamental shift in how artists and fans interact.
