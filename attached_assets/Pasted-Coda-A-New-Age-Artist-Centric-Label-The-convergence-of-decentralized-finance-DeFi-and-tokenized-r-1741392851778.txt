Coda: A New Age Artist-Centric Label
The convergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenized royalty streams (RTs) presents a paradigm shift in music industry financing. It enables artists to collateralize future earnings, crowdsource production capital, and maintain ownership of their royalties without the need for a traditional record label contract. Built on the Original Works (docs) protocol, our platform ensures that artists retain complete control over their music rights forever.
By transforming royalties into liquid assets, artists can access upfront capital, establish revolving credit lines tied to real-time earnings, and engage fans as direct stakeholders in their success. Beyond financing, our marketplace unbundles traditional label services, allowing artists to allocate funding toward marketing, production, and distribution on their terms. Coda is unbundling the traditional record label model by providing on-demand funding, continuous liquidity, and artist-controlled services. Artists can finance, distribute, and market their music without signing away their rights.
How It Works
Production Capital (Crowdfunding): Before release, artists raise funds by pre-selling Royalty Token Futures, allowing fans to back a song’s success. Funds are distributed in milestones—recording, mixing, and marketing—ensuring capital is used efficiently.
Revolving Credit (Real-Time Liquidity): Once live, RTs convert streaming royalties into on-chain assets tradable via Original Works. Artists can borrow against future earnings through DeFi credit lines, unlocking continuous funding tied to real-time performance.
Services Marketplace (A Label Without Ownership): Artists choose how to spend their funding through our curated marketplace for marketing, PR, playlisting, and touring—without label lock-ins or hidden fees.
White-Label Solutions (Scale Beyond a Single Label): Coda powers independent labels, collectives, and distributors with custom interfaces for their catalogs.
A Label Without Ownership—Only Incentives
Unlike traditional labels that own artists’ catalogs, Coda is a financial backbone, not a gatekeeper. Artists keep 100% of their master rights, while Coda earns revenue from transaction fees, DeFi lending spreads, and SaaS partnerships.
This is the future of artist-owned music finance—a decentralized, transparent, and scalable model that ensures artists thrive on their terms.
