Fuck Your Label, Own Your Music
You finish your project. It’s ready to release. Normally, this means chasing a label, signing a contract, and giving up ownership in exchange for an advance—if you’re lucky. Then come the endless royalty delays, hidden fees, and streaming payouts so small they barely cover a coffee.
Coda Collective changes that. Here, artists keep real ownership of their music while tapping into a system designed to handle everything without giving up control.
How It Works
When your project is accepted, an AI Release Manager is created specifically for it. This isn’t just a tool—it’s an onchain agent that interacts with the royalties smart contract, controls all revenue, and manages the wallet that receives earnings from your release. Think of it as an automated record label, but instead of a company taking control, you and your supporters own the value of your work.
But music doesn’t exist onchain—it earns revenue in the real world. That’s where Original Works comes in. They act as the distributor, collecting royalties from streaming platforms, licensing deals, and publishing revenue, and then tokenizing those royalties. Once converted into onchain payments, these earnings are automatically split and distributed—without waiting for a quarterly statement.
Your Music, Your Equity
Here’s where it gets interesting. You keep 50% of all revenue collected by the distributor—not just as royalties, but as actual equity in your project. These liquid financial assets can be sold, traded, or used like any other valuable property. Unlike traditional royalties that are locked up for months (or years), your earnings become instantly accessible at the moment.
Meanwhile, the rest is available to fans and collectors, allowing them to buy in and share in the upside. A small portion goes to Coda’s smart contract, which a company doesn’t control—it’s an automated system that redistributes a portion of every project’s success back to past artists.
The Flywheel Effect: Artists Supporting Artists
Every time your project generates revenue for the distributor the AI Release Manager automatically distributes payments. A small portion goes back to all past artists from the label. This creates a flywheel effect. As more artists release music through Coda, the entire ecosystem benefits. Past artists now have a financial incentive to promote new releases, because every project contributes back to the ones that came before it. The more the system grows, the more everyone earns—not just from their own work, but from the success of future artists.
A Smarter Way to Release Music
Coda isn’t a record label in the traditional sense—it’s an on-chain system that ensures artists get paid fairly and instantly. Every project operates transparently, with AI handling logistics, smart contracts ensuring fair distribution, and Original Works bridging the gap between real-world earnings and on-chain payments.
Artists don’t have to chase payments, negotiate contracts, or give up control. Once a release is live, the AI Release Manager does the work, making sure your music doesn’t just drop and disappear into the algorithm—it continues generating revenue, paying you and your supporters forever.
This is what music ownership should look like. No waiting. No middlemen deciding what gets paid and when. Just artists, their fans, and a system that rewards music the way it should.
